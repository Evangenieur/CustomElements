## Using Grunt To Minify WebComponents Source

You need `grunt-cli` to run the grunt task from the command line.

> `npm install -g grunt-cli`

You need `grunt` itself, and some plugins. Invoke

> `WebComponents> npm install`

And `npm` will install these for you locally.

After those steps the build task should be available:

> `WebComponents> grunt`

Note

`node_modules` and the built files are listed in WebComponents\.gitignore
